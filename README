calc - lightweight command-line calculator

---------------------------------------------------

calc is a simple terminal calculator designed to support both simple and
sophisitcated mathematical expressions using natural (infix) language and
relaxed parsing requirements.

Some examples of supported expressions include:

	> 9 + -10
	  = -1
	> sin((4.25*5) / 9.1)
	  = 0.957399
	> -2.102 ^ cos PI
	  = -0.475737
	> log (1000), 10; sqrt(9)
	  = 3
	  = 9
