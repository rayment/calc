INSTALL
-------

The following build requirements must be met to compile and install calc:
  - A C99 compatible C compiler
  - GNU compatible Make
  - GNU readline and GNU history libraries

Instructions:
  - Go to the project root directory and run `make' to compile the program.
  - Now run `make install' to install the binary to the system.
    Note that admin permissions may be required to run this command.
    Note also that a Unix-like system is most likely required.
  - If your C compiler does not have a system link to `cc', edit Makefile
    and change the 'CC' variable to the correct command.

UNINSTALL
---------

The binary is installed by default to:
	/usr/local/bin

- This file can be removed by running
  `make uninstall'.
- Otherwise, you may remove the file manually with no negative consequence.
- Note that admin permissions may be required to remove the file.
